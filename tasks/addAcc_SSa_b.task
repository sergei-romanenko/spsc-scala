-- This example shows a good side of the whistle, based on homeomorphic
-- embedding. In the sequence
--     addAcc(S(S(a)), b) --> addAcc(S(a), S(b)) --> addAdd(a, S(S(b)))
-- all configurations are considered as "non-related", because there is
-- no imbedding. Thus the supercompiler is able to perform 2 reductions steps
-- removing 2 S-constructors.

addAcc(S(S(a)), b)
where

addAcc(Z, y) = y;
addAcc(S(x), y) = addAcc(x, S(y));
