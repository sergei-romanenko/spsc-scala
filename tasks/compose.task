-- Function composition.

-- This sample shows that SPSC is able to transform a 2-pass algorithm to
-- a 1-pass one.
-- SPSC notes that b(a(A(x))) --> b(B(a(x))) --> C(b(a(x)) and creates
-- a recursively defined function b1 such that calling b1(...) produces
-- the same result as calling b(a(...)).

b(a(u))
where

a(Stop) = Stop;
a(A(x)) = B(a(x));

b(Stop) = Stop;
b(B(x)) = C(b(x));
